Perhaps u can achieve certain types of RPP for certain types of roleplay.

EG: ERPP - Instead of a penalty u get some useless rpp that can be used for a rebirth into a equally bad but degenerate race (Demon - Succubus)
CombatRPP - Martial prowess!
CraftingRPP - Crafting shit

idk, makes more sense and we can reduce apps for stuff/promote other things more naturally without telling ppl to do it.
