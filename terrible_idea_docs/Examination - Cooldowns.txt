Basically I'm going to be examining my memory of cooldowns in the games we r being similar too, along with like
things similar to the games we r being similar to, thusly as far as i know.
This examination done by JTGSZ incase shit be off af.

Global Cooldown - 
	Basically puts everything that is tagged GCD into global cooldown, 
	GCD potentially gets reduced by agility depending on skill, Aka: Agility and Basic Melee Attack.
	Not All GCDs are EQUAL. EG: Basic Melee Attack, Block, etc 0.5s GCD versus Fireball 2.5s GCD
	
	Thusly, we can divine that there are three tiers of cooldowns. (DELAY - GLOBAL DELAY - OFF GLOBAL DELAY)
	OR
	The skills set the GCD afterwards, weird to think about huh.
	Some skills also insta-cast, others need you to finish some anim before allowing movement/doing anything etc.
	
	Thusly cooldown structure can either be like.
	
	Skill	--->	Skill	--->	Skill
	GCD	Delay	OGCD	Delay	GCD

	
	OR
	
	Skill	--->	Skill	--->	Skill
	GCD	Delay	OGCD	No	GCD
	
	idk
