The paths of nodes on the server must match the paths on the clients, for communication.
As the RPC call occurs on the same node path on the targeted/or all ID peers.

Example:
Server: Handler -> Main -> Player (rpc call "weiner")
Client: Handler -> Main -> Player (gets "weiner" called)

Heres an error example.
Server: Handler -> Main -> Player -> Tiger (rpc call "weiner")
Client: Handler -> Main -> Player -> Doesn't Exist (gets "weiner" called on non-existent tiger node and we get errors.)


Server is peer id 1, only the multiplayer authority can call shit on a node, so make sure the caller and the authority are fine re: shit.
