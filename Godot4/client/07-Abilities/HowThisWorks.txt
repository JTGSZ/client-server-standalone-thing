Basically, here is how the ability system works.
On each body, there is an ability holder.

===How the ability nodes work===
1. We instance the scene here.
2. We cram it into the ability holder
3. We add it to the ability holder's dictionary via add_ability
	3.1 Take note, we also need to remove it from the ability holder's dictionary if we delete the node.
	
4. The user can cram it onto a hotbar, or activate it however.
5. We call the ability holder, and perform the actions it wants.


Things:
	These are just the nodes that do the things.
	To note we won't store something like a icicle spear(Projectile) in here,
	Simply because the projectile can be used in several spells.
