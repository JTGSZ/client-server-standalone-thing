# client-server-standalone-thing

How 2 run it:
  1. Start both client and server projects in ur godot 4 editor.
  2. Hit start on the dedicated server
  3. Hit join on the client
  4. Now ur client is connected to ur server.
  
Important Note: 
    You need to join ur server via 127.0.0.1 on local client, even if other people are connecting to it via ur normal IP Address.

Godot 3 is the project before I ported it to Godot 4.
The singleplayer client in godot 4 is just the topdown game before I put in all the rpc shit.
